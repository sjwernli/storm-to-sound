            <h4>In large cities like Seattle, rain can’t be absorbed the same way it is in forests. Due to large areas of impervious material, such as concrete, glass, steel, and compact soil, untreated stormwater drains into the nearest body of water. This water carries toxins that are harmful to aquatic organisms and can even be a health risk to humans. A study from WSU found that when exposed to stormwater runoff, 100% of the salmon died compared to 0% of those placed in freshwater. This is a major problem to our ecosystem. Polluted rivers prevent salmon from spawning. Wildlife can get sick from drinking water and our own water source could be polluted. </h4>

            <h2>Types of Pollutants</h2>
            <h4>There are many different pollutants that can be found in stormwater. All of these would be toxic to humans if found in our drinking water. So why do we let fish live in it? Hover over each pollutant to learn more about its source and effect on organisms. </h4>

            <h3 class="inverse" style="text-align: center">Oil</h3>
            <h4>Often left on streets by leaky engines and fuel tanks, oil is easily washed into storm drains and flushed into aquatic habitats. Unfortunately, oil is toxic to most aquatic organisms. It can coat gills and prevent oxygen from entering the water. </h4>

        <section class="show-on-scroll expand">
            <h3 class="inverse" style="text-align: center">Metals</h3>
            <h4>Metals such as lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium are commonly found in storm water.  They concentrate in sediments and cause health problems to bottom-dwelling fish and animals such as disrupting reproductive cycles. Copper interferes with sense of smell making fish vulnerable to predators. Vehicle brake pads account for an estimated 60,000kg of copper a year that enters the Puget Sound.</h4>

            <h3 class="inverse" style="text-align: center">Sediment/Organic Waste</h3>
            <h4>Sediment washed off pavement and exposed soil can cloud water (limiting the ability of plants to photosynthesize), smother fish eggs, and destroy insect habitats. Organic waste such as leaves and yard waste settle on the bottom of lakes and slower streams to decompose. Too many nutrients cause algal blooms and lower dissolved oxygen levels. Some forms of algae are toxic and harm fish and wildlife. Both sediment and organic waste can clog drains leading to maintenance costs and flooding. </h4>

            <h3 class="inverse" style="text-align: center">Fecal Coliform Bacteria</h3>
            <h4>These are bacteria and micro-organisms like E. Coli and Giardia found in pet waste that can make people sick. When in lakes, rivers, or oceans, people can accidentally swallow them while swimming or ingest them through shellfish. </h4>

            <h4>In December 2020, researchers discovered the chemical that is the leading cause of death to salmon in urban streams. The chemical, 6-PPD-quinone, is created when 6-PPD, a chemical found in tires, reacts with ozone. Tiny particles that wear off of tires enter stormwater carrying this toxic chemical. 6-PPD-quinone kills up to 50% of salmon before they are able to spawn. </h4>

            <h2>Solutions:</h2>
            <h4>Fortunately, there are ways to prevent polluted stormwater from flowing into the Puget Sound. In fact, there are cheap, ecofriendly solutions that you can integrate into your home.  By imitating a forests natural way of absorbing and purifying water, we can treat stormwater without spending money on new storm drains and treatment facilities.</h4>
